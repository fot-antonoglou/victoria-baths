    <h1 class="text-success text-center">My visit to Victoria Baths.</h1> 
    
    <p class="text-center">
        On Saturday the 7th of September 2019, I went with my mother in Victoria Baths, which is a building with
        swimming pools, to swim. The people, who had reopened that place, wanted to make that building as it
        was before by colllecting money. The baths, opened for first time in 1906 and it closed in 1993.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-primary text-center">What I did there</h3>

    <p class="text-center">
        When I went in that building, I'was in one of the swimming pools called the Gala pool. There were many
        changing rooms, but they were narrow and I'm was hitting my leg on the wall. In the swimming pool,
        there were many iflatables of different shapes, such as flamingoes, watermelons and a submarine. I tried to be on the
        submarine but at the first time, I'm was fell of it.

    <p class="text-center">
        Then we went to the top part of the building and 
        I saw the walls there some of them were broken. There was a fire place aswell in one of the rooms. In another 
        part of the building, there was another swimming pool to used only by women. This was called Female pool, but it wasn't 
        restored so we couldn't swim there. In that room, there was a beautiful picture on glass. It was like a whale 
        or dolphin. In another part of the building, there was something like a big cyllinder that you could be inside it, 
        then some water was coming in and it was doing bubbles on you're body as massage. In another part of the building, 
        I saw a photograph from the past, they were teaching younglings how to swim on chairs. There was another part of the building called Turkish baths, 
        but there were only showers and one bookcase. So it was a pleasure for me.

    <h3 class="text-warning text-center">History</h3>

    <p class="text-center">
        The disgner of the baths was Henry Price who created the department of the City Architect of 1902 
        ( 4 years before Victoria Baths were opened to the public). The lord Mayor of Manchester (Cllr Abid Latif Chohan) 
        had named the baths the name they have now, and he described the baths as a "water palace". 
        The baths had provided leisure and essential facilities ( for 83 years). A laundry a Turkish bath were housed 
        there along with a sauna and three swimming pools. The main swimming pool was floored (in winter months) to hold some dances. 
        In 1952, the baths had instaled the first public jacuzzi in Englad. A great deal of money 
        (in the desighn and constructionof the baths). At that time, Manchester was having one of the wealthiest munical 
        coffers in the world. The Manchester City Council closed the baths in 1993. The friends of Victoria Baths 
        had formed and began to investigating the possibility of running Victoria Baths (indepedently). 
        The work to a prevent further deterionation of the building had started in 1998.

    <p class="text-center">
        In September  2003, tha baths won the first series of the BBC Restoration programme. 
        It was awarded with 3.4 million pounds from the Hertage Lottery Fund. To help celebrate the win, 
        the prince of Wales visited the baths, one month later.In September 2005, 
        the baths had recieved the final plan to start the restoration process. 
        In 2006, the Gala pool was fulled in 13 years time for the first time, 
        as part of an event number to mark the centenary of the building's opening. 
        On Monday 19th September 2007, the first work of the restoration began and it was complete in 2008. 
        In 2011, the baths were used as a location of filming. On the 16th of April 2017, the baths were reopened again, 
        only for an acid dance party hosted by a room of Boiler.
